# alarm_box

Our product aims to discourage the snooze habit and promote an active start to the day.

## Inspiration
Our friend had trouble waking up and would constantly snooze his alarm. Our solution was to create an innovative box that would keep his phone locked up, stopping him from hitting the snooze button. The only way to get his phone back would be to physically get up and use a key card to open our box which in return get him ready for the day.

## What it does
Our project operates as follows: the user starts by using the alarm box app on their phone to arm the system. They then place their phone inside the box. Once the box is closed, the user will no longer have access to their phone, preventing them from snoozing their alarm. To open the box in the morning, the user must physically get up and use a key card, which will wake them up.

## How we built it
We built our project using many different pieces of hardware and software. The main software components we used in our project include Flutter, dart, and Firebase. We used Flutter and Dart to code our app and create a user-friendly GUI and Firebase was used for state management and backend data storage. The hardware we used included a Raspberry Pi, servo motors, breadboards, and wiring. The Raspberry Pi was the main piece of hardware we used to control the servo motors and locking box mechanism.
